For ten days a year, on a wild island in the middle of the Danube, the size of a football stadium, which becomes welcoming only during this period, we bring high-performance technologies, renowned lecturers, and virtually invite specialists from around the world to share their experiences through teleconferences. The activities during the Atlantykron Academy cover a wide range, from science and culture to art and sports. Over 30 interesting activities take place here, 24 hours a day. Over time, more than 10,000 young people and guests have visited this island, learning from each other.",

    "history2": "In 1990, a small group of science fiction enthusiasts chose this remote island as an ideal, albeit wild, location for the annual science fiction festival, which offered them the opportunity to study and learn from each other. Time passed, conditions changed, but the thirst for knowledge and new experiences remained. After 10 years, the festival transformed into a Summer School. The tradition continued, with the support of the government and non-governmental organizations from around the world.",
    "history3": "Over time, more than 10,000 guests, participants, and organizers have visited this island. Since 1990, Atlantykron has been under the auspices of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and has consistently received support and assistance from several government agencies (such as the Ministry of Agriculture through ANIF, the National Forestry Directorate), local authorities such as the Cernavoda City Hall, as well as local businesses.",
    "history4": "Some of the most significant years for Atlantykron Academy include 1999 when the edition was dedicated to the total solar eclipse, 2001 when the island hosted Eurocon, the European Science Fiction Convention, and 2019 when the Academy celebrated its 30th anniversary. Over the years, Atlantykron Academy has hosted numerous personalities, including astronaut Dumitru Prunariu, science fiction writers Norman Spinrad (President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America at that time), Joe Haldeman, Robert Sheckley, Alain LeBussy, Ion Hobana, astronomer Harald Alexandrescu, artists Ioan Gyury Pascu, Cristian Grețcu, the Barock band, geneticist Jonathan Cowie, Bridget Willkinson (President of the European Science Fiction Society), biologist Alexandru Ecovoiu, Gheorghe Fodoreanu (former president of the National Association of Travel Agencies), Peter Moon (American writer), pan flutist Nicolae Voiculeț, and many others.",
    "history5": "In 2014, the Atlantykron organizing team, in partnership with Innovation Travel and the National Tourism Authority, organized the conference \"The Danube, Romania's Touristic Treasure,\" which brought together over 300 participants and guests. On the day of the conference, pan flutist Nicolae Voiculeț held a memorable concert.",
    "history6": "In 2015, Atlantykron Academy received well-deserved honors for its 25 years of activity celebrated in 2014, including a nomination at the Foreign Policy magazine Gala in the research section, alongside the \"Horia Hulubei\" Institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering, all the winners of the Ad Astra 2014 awards, and a series of remarkable Romanian researchers from both Romania and abroad. It was also nominated by Radio Romania Cultural in the \"Education and Teaching\" category.",
    "history7": "Atlantykron is a wild island, a place that only experiences fireworks, electricity, high-speed internet for virtual conferences - a science fiction idea in the early editions of the 1990s - large screens projecting premiere images from Mars, and last but not least, conferences held by specialists in the fields of science, culture, art, and communication."
